       	 <p>Guard is when you twirl flags and do amazing tosses that'll make the crowd
       	 go wild!!</p><!--End of Paragraph 1-->
       	 <p>In order to join you must be in Marching Band and you can ask the band director
       	 to place you in Guard and then you're all set for the time of your life!!
       	 When you join you will get a flag bag where you will keep flags you need for
       	 the routines you do and a practice flag that you can take home and practice!!
       	 The routines will take some time to learn but after you learn the routines 
       	 you'll become a natural at guard and you can tell your friends that you do a 
       	 sport that you absolutely enjoy!! When you are a Senior you can even run for
       	 guard captain which means that when the guard director is not present
       	 you are the boss and you tell people in guard what you want them to do.</p><!--End of Paragraph 2-->
       	 <p>The routine you absolutely must learn is Parade Routine which is the routine
       	 we use for when we perform in parades! My favorite part of the routine is when
       	 we do the mica toss at the end of the parade routine. A few tosses that we do is 
       	 we do a peggy toss which is the most complicated toss in guard but my favorite
       	 toss because of the way the flag goes when you do the toss. We also have 
       	 a mica toss which is the easiest you just cross you right arm underneath of you
       	 left and you just toss it!! There are more tosses to learn but they are more
       	 complicated to learn but feel free to try the tosses on your own time!!</p><!--End of Paragraph 3-->
